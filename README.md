Diabetes Prediction Analysis using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on various medical attributes using supervised machine learning algorithms. It provides a complete data science pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.

Project Overview
Goal: Predict the onset of diabetes using medical diagnostic data.

Dataset: Pima Indians Diabetes Database

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

ML Models Used:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Key Steps
1.Data Loading
Loaded the dataset and explored data shape, types, and sample values.

2.EDA & Data Cleaning

Checked for missing values

Handled outliers and zero entries in critical medical columns

Visualized feature distributions and correlations

3.Feature Engineering

Scaled data using StandardScaler

Converted categorical variables if required

4.Model Building

Split data into training and test sets

Trained multiple ML models

Compared their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

5.Visualization

Plotted confusion matrix and classification report

Visual comparison of model performances

Model Performance Summary
Model	Accuracy
Logistic Regression	76%
Decision Tree	72%
Random Forest	78%
KNN	74%

Best Model: Random Forest (highest accuracy)
